{"message":"cannot move out of `*curr_command_temp` which is behind a shared reference","code":{"code":"E0507","explanation":"A borrowed value was moved out.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0507\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\n\nstruct TheDarkKnight;\n\nimpl TheDarkKnight {\n    fn nothing_is_true(self) {}\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x = RefCell::new(TheDarkKnight);\n\n    x.borrow().nothing_is_true(); // error: cannot move out of borrowed content\n}\n```\n\nHere, the `nothing_is_true` method takes the ownership of `self`. However,\n`self` cannot be moved because `.borrow()` only provides an `&TheDarkKnight`,\nwhich is a borrow of the content owned by the `RefCell`. To fix this error,\nyou have three choices:\n\n* Try to avoid moving the variable.\n* Somehow reclaim the ownership.\n* Implement the `Copy` trait on the type.\n\nThis can also happen when using a type implementing `Fn` or `FnMut`, as neither\nallows moving out of them (they usually represent closures which can be called\nmore than once). Much of the text following applies equally well to non-`FnOnce`\nclosure bodies.\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\n\nstruct TheDarkKnight;\n\nimpl TheDarkKnight {\n    fn nothing_is_true(&self) {} // First case, we don't take ownership\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x = RefCell::new(TheDarkKnight);\n\n    x.borrow().nothing_is_true(); // ok!\n}\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\n\nstruct TheDarkKnight;\n\nimpl TheDarkKnight {\n    fn nothing_is_true(self) {}\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x = RefCell::new(TheDarkKnight);\n    let x = x.into_inner(); // we get back ownership\n\n    x.nothing_is_true(); // ok!\n}\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\n\n#[derive(Clone, Copy)] // we implement the Copy trait\nstruct TheDarkKnight;\n\nimpl TheDarkKnight {\n    fn nothing_is_true(self) {}\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x = RefCell::new(TheDarkKnight);\n\n    x.borrow().nothing_is_true(); // ok!\n}\n```\n\nMoving a member out of a mutably borrowed struct will also cause E0507 error:\n\n```compile_fail,E0507\nstruct TheDarkKnight;\n\nimpl TheDarkKnight {\n    fn nothing_is_true(self) {}\n}\n\nstruct Batcave {\n    knight: TheDarkKnight\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut cave = Batcave {\n        knight: TheDarkKnight\n    };\n    let borrowed = &mut cave;\n\n    borrowed.knight.nothing_is_true(); // E0507\n}\n```\n\nIt is fine only if you put something back. `mem::replace` can be used for that:\n\n```\n# struct TheDarkKnight;\n# impl TheDarkKnight { fn nothing_is_true(self) {} }\n# struct Batcave { knight: TheDarkKnight }\nuse std::mem;\n\nlet mut cave = Batcave {\n    knight: TheDarkKnight\n};\nlet borrowed = &mut cave;\n\nmem::replace(&mut borrowed.knight, TheDarkKnight).nothing_is_true(); // ok!\n```\n\nFor more information on Rust's ownership system, take a look at the\n[References & Borrowing][references-and-borrowing] section of the Book.\n\n[references-and-borrowing]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src/main.rs","byte_start":947,"byte_end":965,"line_start":44,"line_end":44,"column_start":34,"column_end":52,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    self.curr_command_words.push(*curr_command_temp);","highlight_start":34,"highlight_end":52}],"label":"move occurs because `*curr_command_temp` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0507]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: cannot move out of `*curr_command_temp` which is behind a shared reference\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0msrc/main.rs:44:34\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m44\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m    self.curr_command_words.push(*curr_command_temp);\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                 \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9mmove occurs because `*curr_command_temp` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait\u001b[0m\n\n"}
